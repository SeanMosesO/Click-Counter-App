# Click-Counter-App
Mini Project Assessment: Click Counter App

Objective: The goal of this project is to build a simple Click Counter application using React state. Users should be able to increase or decrease the count by clicking on respective buttons.

1. Setting Up the Counter Component Create a functional component to manage the counter. Use the useState hook to store and update the counter value.

2. Adding Buttons for User Interaction Add an "Increase" button to increment the counter. Add a "Decrease" button to decrement the counter. Ensure that the counter updates in real time when buttons are clicked.

3. Handling Edge Cases Prevent the counter from going below zero (optional). Display a message if the counter reaches a certain threshold (e.g,. "You've reached the limit!").

Requirements: Use React functional components with hooks (useState). Implement a clean UI with proper styling. Ensure buttons properly update the state on click.
